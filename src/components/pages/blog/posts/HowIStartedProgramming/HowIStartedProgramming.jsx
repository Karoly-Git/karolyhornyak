                <h2>Automating the Boring Stuff</h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking back, I’ve always been drawn to automating the boring stuff. Long before I ever
                    considered becoming a developer, I found myself looking for ways to make repetitive tasks
                    faster, cleaner, and less painful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One moment stands out clearly. At the university, where I studied mechanical engineering, we were
                    given a technical iteration assignment — for non-engineers, that basically means doing the same
                    set of calculations over and over until the final value lands within a very narrow acceptable range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of grinding through endless recalculations like everyone else, I built an Excel
                    sheet with custom formulas that handled the entire process automatically. What normally
                    took students hours or even days suddenly took me about an hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I probably don’t need to mention how popular I became after that — or how much extra money
                    I made helping my classmates finish the same assignment. Let’s just say automation paid
                    off in more ways than one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking back now, that was probably my first real experience of thinking like a developer —
                    spotting repetition, reducing error, and building a simple system instead of doing manual work.

                <h2>A Very Long Detour</h2>
                <p>
                    That happened back in the early 2000s — and then, for the next twenty years, I didn’t think about a
                    programming career. My professional journey took me across several different fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those two decades were full of adventures, changes, and life happening. But let’s fast-forward to 2018,
                    when I had already been living in the UK for three years and, after holding various positions, had
                    just started working as a production supervisor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It didn’t take long to realise just how painfully inefficient everything was. Procedures,
                    documentation, daily processes — all of it was extremely paper-heavy and error-prone.
                    Excel was everywhere, but used in a way that made work harder instead of easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It felt like we weren’t using computers to support our work — we were working for the computer.
                </p>

                <h2>Hitting the Limits of Excel</h2>
                <p>
                    I started creating Excel macros to make my own job easier, and for a while, that helped.
                    But very quickly I reached the limits of what spreadsheets could realistically do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I needed something more flexible, more reliable, and more professional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was the point where I started looking for better tools — not just to save time, but to
                    reduce errors and make processes more robust.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Learning to Code — For Real</h2>
                <p>
                    During my search, I quickly realised that I needed to dive into programming, and I came
                    across a company called <a href="https://programozaskarrier.hu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming & Career</a>. They offered a one-year frontend web developer
                    training programme, and it immediately felt like the right choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enrolled, committed fully, and successfully completed the programme. That year became one
                    of the most intense learning periods of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned the fundamentals of Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Git, GitHub, React
                    and a bit of Node.js with Express. Every free moment I had — evenings, weekends, early mornings —
                    went into learning, practicing, and building small websites just to see if I could make them work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Somewhere along the way, something clicked. Nothing I had studied or worked on before ever
                    felt this natural. Programming didn’t just make sense — it felt right.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>When It Became Obvious</h2>
                <p>
                    As my understanding grew, so did my ideas. Suddenly, I couldn’t stop thinking about all
                    the applications I could build to make everyday work easier: key registers, collection
                    trackers, padlock registers, production trackers — and many more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was also something deeply reassuring about programming. Unlike many other professions,
                    making mistakes didn’t hurt anyone physically or financially. If I broke something, I could
                    simply delete the code and try again. No real damage — just learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the deeper I went, the clearer it became that frontend alone wasn’t enough. Every feature
                    eventually needs a backend, data, logic, and structure behind it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I enrolled in a one-year full-stack web developer programme at <a href="https://itcareerswitch.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT Career Switch</a> — and
                    completed that as well.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>All In</h2>
                <p>
                    By the end of that journey, there was no doubt left. This wasn’t just a career change or a
                    new skill — it was a direction that finally felt right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And this is where Part 1 of the story ends. Part 2 is where things start getting very real —
                    applying what I’ve learned, building real projects, and trying to break into the industry.
